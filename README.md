# hello-world
Hello, world. My development skills are super rusty and I need a way to practice, and hopefully also help my kids learn to code if/when they're interested. A few things I'm checking out:

# Exercism
[Exercism](http://exercism.io/languages/python/about) is great for folks who grew up on the command line. There are several languages from which to choose, and you basically are able to pull down, work on and submit one exercise at a time. Successful solutions are visible in a forum, where people can view what others have done and compare solutions. I haven't seen too much conversational code review and discussion yet, but it's a smaller community than hackerrank and feels more accessible.

# Python Challenge
I've also been trying out [Python Challenge](http://exercism.io/languages/python/about), which has more of a puzzle feel. Again, you have to solve your current challenge before moving on to the next so you only work on one challenge at time. At first, I didn't really get what it was asking me to do but after the first couple, it becomes more clear. Each level has hints, so you shouldn't be too stuck at any one level.

# HackerRank
I'm not committing any [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/dashboard) code here, but it's another set of small programming exercise across multiple languages. I have a love hate relationship with the fact that the tests are hidden. You can pass the primary test and then still fail the submission by missing any number of subsequent hidden tests. I find that that this approach, rightly or wrongly, is not inspiring me to be a better tester. However, I'm still in survey mode at the moment, trying a bunch of things, so it may be some time before I settle down into a small number of learning sites.

# Practice Python - Beginner Python Exercises
I haven't really gotten into the exercises at [Practice Python](http://www.practicepython.org/) but I may use these with my son. I'm thinking about helping him start a coding club at his middle school, but I have a feeling that these exercises may be a bit too dry for the middle school set.
